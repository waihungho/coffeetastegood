Simply Modbus programs in Windows 7 :

The Simply Modbus programs were around long before Windows 7 and work best with XP.  
There are some compatibility issues with Windows 7.  
Here are some ways to get around it.

Start by installing version 7 or higher of the Simply Modbus program.

1. Find or create a shortcut to the SimplyModbus program.
2. Right click on the icon and select Properties.
3. Select the "Compatibility" tab.
4. Check "Run this program in compatibility mode for:"
5. Select "Windows XP (Service Pack 3)"
6. Check "Run this program as an adminstrator"

Error-1073807202 may appear for some  users. If so, the program cannot find the VISA serial port drivers.
Downloading and installing NI-VISA run time engine 4.2 from the NI website should resolve the error.

The programs may also work in Windows7 using virtual XP mode, a free download from Microsoft.

------------
You can download and install multiple versions of the programs to see how they each behave without removing the older ones.  
This allows you try them all and use the version that works best for you. 
All versions of the same type of software (RTU Master) will use the existing license if already installed on the PC.
