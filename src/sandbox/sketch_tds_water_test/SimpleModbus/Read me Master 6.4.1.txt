The downloaded zip file, SimplyModbusMaster6.4.zip,  contains:
           Simply Modbus Master 6.4.1.exe  - the program 
           serpdrv                                      - serial port driver
                              (serpdrv must be in the same folder as the exe to allow the program to access serial ports)
           Read me Master 6.4.1.txt               - this file
           Read me for Windows 7.txt        - some additional notes about running on Windows 7

1) Unzip the files into the same folder.

2) If using Windows 7, Activate Windows XP compatibility as shown in the file Read me for Windows 7.txt 

3) Double-click Simply Modbus Master 6.4.1.exe to start the program.

4) Enter the input info: 
      eg.  mode = RTU
           COM port = 1 to 99
           port settings = 19200 baud, 8 data bits, 1 stop bit, no parity 
           Slave ID = 10 
           First Register = 40001 
           No. of Registers = 10
   The Command to be sent will appear in "Request".

5) Press the SEND button.  All bytes received will appear in "Response".
   The response time is shown in 0.1 increments. The response progress bar fills as the the time approached the "fail in" time entered.
   If no answer appears within the "fail in" time, increase the "fail in" time and press SEND again.

6) Set the format of the received data.
   check or uncheck 'High byte/Low byte'
   check or uncheck 'Low word/High word'
   Data Types: 32bit Float - 32bit IEEE Floating Point
               32bit UINT  - Unsigned Integer (0 to 4.3 billion)
               32bit INT   - Signed Integer   (-2.1 to 2.1 billion)
               16bit UINT  - Unsigned Integer (0 to 65535)
               16bit INT   - Signed Integer   (-32768 to 32767)
               2chString   - 16bit - 2 character STRING
               4chString   - 32bit - 4 character STRING
               6chString   - 48bit - 6 character STRING
               8chString   - 64bit - 8 character STRING
               12chString  - 96bit -12 character STRING
               16chString  - 128bit-16 character STRING
               8 boolean   - 8 bit - 8 status ON/OFF

--- Use Defaults ---

The automatic settings are shown inside the Use Defaults box.
These settings are automatically set to these defaults whenever "First Register" is changed.

First Register   Function Code   Register Size   Offset
00001-10000           1           1 bit coils        1
10001-30000           2           1 bit coils    10001
30001-40000           4           16 bit regs    30001
40001+                   3           16 bit regs    40001

Enron exceptions:
First Register   Function Code   Register Size   Offset
32               (events)    3           32 bit regs        0
701-799       (history)    3           32 bit regs        0
1001-1999 (boolean)    1            1 bit coils        0
3001-3999 (short int)    3           16 bit regs        0
5001-5999 (long int)    3           32 bit regs        0
7001-7999   (floats)     3            32 bit regs        0

For Simply Write Modbus:
First Register   Function Code   Register Size   Offset
00001-10000           5(15*)      1 bit coils        1
10001-30000           5(15*)      1 bit coils    10001
30001-40000           6(16*)      16 bit regs    30001
40001+                   6(16*)      16 bit regs    40001
 *Function codes 15 and 16 are used when writing multiple values.

The "send continuously" check box may be turned on. This will have the effect of repeatedly pressing the SEND button. Increase "pause between sends" in seconds to slow down the rate the requests are sent.

If RTS delay is required, for communication through MDS4310A and MDS4710B radios for example, check the RTS delay check box. Enter the 'ON' and 'OFF' delay in milliseconds.

--- Saved Configurations ---
The settings can be saved to text files with the SAVE CFG button and resored with the RESTORE CFG button.
